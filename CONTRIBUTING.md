## ✅ How to Contribute

### Pull Requests

> **Must Use PR templates according to your requirement.**
### 💻Code PRs
- Currently, we only cover problems of [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/), [GeeksForGeeks](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/explore?page=1&sortBy=submissions) and [InterviewBit](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/explore?page=1&sortBy=submissions). Problems of other good platforms can be accepted(ONLY AFTER [DISCUSSIONS](https://github.com/Sagar0-0/DsA/discussions)).
- We maintain the structure of repositroy by creating specific directories corresponding to coding platoforms i.e. [Leetcode](https://github.com/Sagar0-0/DsA/tree/main/Leetcode), [GFG](https://github.com/Sagar0-0/DsA/tree/main/GFG), [Interviewbit](https://github.com/Sagar0-0/DsA/tree/main/Interviewbit).
- ⚠️Please contribute your code in the right directory!! Example - LeetCode questions should be in the [LeetCode directory](https://github.com/Sagar0-0/DsA/tree/main/Leetcode) and same for others.
- **MUST CHECK** if that question already exists or not!! Follow following steps:  
Example- A solution named "Nine divisors.java" is to be added, then first check if any directory(or new PR) with the name "Nine divisors" exists or not and if yes, then move to "Nine divisors" directory and then add your code there(if java file exists then append in that file) or if that folder doesn't exists then create a folder/directory with the name "Nine divisors" and then add your code. [How to create a folder/directory?](https://stackoverflow.com/a/34259067/16775065)
- File naming convention: 
  - Every word in the file should be separated by a space. eg. "Rat in the maze" , "19. Remove Nth Node From End of List", etc.
  - ❌No other naming format will be accepted from now.(to maintian the structure)




### ❌Note: Creating multiple wrong PRs can lead to a permanent ban.❌
